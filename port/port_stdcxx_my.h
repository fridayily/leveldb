/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _ISOC2X_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C2X.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__
			ISO C2X interfaces defined only in Annex F.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE_SOURCE Select correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* GNU formerly extended the scanf functions with modified format
   specifiers %as, %aS, and %a[...] that allocate a buffer for the
   input using malloc.  This extension conflicts with ISO C99, which
   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

/* The fallback definitions, for when __WCHAR_MAX__ or __WCHAR_MIN__

//
// The numeric_limits<> traits document implementation-defined aspects
// of fundamental arithmetic data types (integers and floating points).
// From Standard C++ point of view, there are 14 such types:
//   * integers
//         bool							(1)
//         char, signed char, unsigned char, wchar_t            (4)
//         short, unsigned short				(2)
//         int, unsigned					(2)
//         long, unsigned long					(2)
//
//   * floating points
//         float						(1)
//         double						(1)
//         long double						(1)
//
// GNU C++ understands (where supported by the host C-library)
//   * integer
//         long long, unsigned long long			(2)
//
// which brings us to 16 fundamental arithmetic data types in GNU C++.
//
//
// Since a numeric_limits<> is a bit tricky to get right, we rely on
// an interface composed of macros which should be defined in config/os
// or config/cpu when they differ from the generic (read arbitrary)
// definitions given here.
//

// These values can be overridden in the target configuration file.
// The default values are appropriate for many 32-bit targets.

// GCC only intrinsically supports modulo integral types.  The only remaining
// integral exceptional values is division by zero.  Only targets that do not
// signal division by zero in some "hard to ignore" way should use false.




// float

// Default values.  Should be overridden in configuration files if necessary.

// This file provides some compile-time information about various types.
// These representations were designed, on purpose, to be constant-expressions
// and not types as found in <bits/type_traits.h>.  In particular, they
// can be used in control structures and the optimizer hopefully will do
// the obvious thing.
//
// Why integral expressions, and not functions nor types?
// Firstly, these compile-time entities are used as template-arguments
// so function return values won't work:  We need compile-time entities.
// We're left with types and constant  integral expressions.
// Secondly, from the point of view of ease of use, type-based compile-time
// information is -not- *that* convenient.  One has to write lots of
// overloaded functions and to hope that the compiler will select the right
// one. As a net effect, the overall structure isn't very clear at first
// glance.
// Thirdly, partial ordering and overload resolution (of function templates)
// is highly costly in terms of compiler-resource.  It is a Good Thing to
// keep these resource consumption as least as possible.

   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value

   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  */

  /** @defgroup functors Function Objects
   *  @ingroup utilities
   *
   *  Function objects, or _functors_, are objects with an `operator()`
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to _functors_, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors `a` and `b` containing `double`,
   *  and put the result in `a`, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in `a`, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will usually be inlined directly.
   *
   *  An _adaptable function object_ is one which provides nested typedefs
   *  `result_type` and either `argument_type` (for a unary function) or
   *  `first_argument_type` and `second_argument_type` (for a binary function).
   *  Those typedefs are used by function object adaptors such as `bind2nd`.
   *  The standard library provides two class templates, `unary_function` and
   *  `binary_function`, which define those typedefs and so can be used as
   *  base classes of adaptable function objects.
   *
   *  Since C++11 the use of function object adaptors has been superseded by
   *  more powerful tools such as lambda expressions, `function<>`, and more
   *  powerful type deduction (using `auto` and `decltype`). The helpers for
   *  defining adaptable function objects are deprecated since C++11, and no
   *  longer part of the standard library since C++17. However, they are still
   *  defined and used by libstdc++ after C++17, as a conforming extension.

   *  };
   *
   *  std::find_if (v.begin(), v.end(), not1(IntGreaterThanThree()));
   *  \endcode
   *  The call to `find_if` will locate the first index (i) of `v` for which
   *  `!(v[i] > 3)` is true.
   *
   *  The not1/unary_negate combination works on predicates taking a single

   *  function pointer `f`, and its `operator()` called with argument `x`
   *  returns `f(x)`.  The functor `pointer_to_binary_function` does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument `f` and `operator()`.

  // 20.3.6 binders
  /** @defgroup binders Binder Classes
   * @ingroup functors
   *
   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

/* If this file is compiled with threads support, it must
       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:
     int __gthread_create (__gthread_t *thread, void *(*func) (void*),
                           void *args);
     int __gthread_join (__gthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
     int __gthread_detach (__gthread_t thread);
     int __gthread_equal (__gthread_t t1, __gthread_t t2);
     __gthread_t __gthread_self (void);

  /* KIND must stay at this position in the structure to maintain
     binary compatibility with static initializers.

     Concurrency notes:
     The __kind of a mutex is initialized either by the static
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER or by a call to pthread_mutex_init.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the __kind of a mutex is usually not
     changed.  BUT it can be set to -1 in pthread_mutex_destroy or elision can
     be enabled.  This is done concurrently in the pthread_mutex_*lock
     functions by using the macro FORCE_ELISION. This macro is only defined
     for architectures which supports lock elision.

     For elision, there are the flags PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP and
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP which can be set in addition to the already
     set type of a mutex.  Before a mutex is initialized, only
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP can be set with pthread_mutexattr_settype.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the functions pthread_mutex_*lock can
     enable elision - if the mutex-type and the machine supports it - by
     setting the flag PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP. This is done concurrently.
     Afterwards the lock / unlock functions are using specific elision
     code-paths.  */

/* Similar to Solaris, HP-UX 11 for PA-RISC provides stubs for pthread
   calls in shared flavors of the HP-UX C library.  Most of the stubs
   have no functionality.  The details are described in the "libc cumulative
   patch" for each subversion of HP-UX 11.  There are two special interfaces
   provided for checking whether an application is linked to a shared pthread
   library or not.  However, these interfaces aren't available in early
   libpthread libraries.  We also need a test that works for archive
   libraries.  We can't use pthread_once as some libc versions call the
   init function.  We also can't use pthread_create or pthread_attr_init
   as these create a thread and thereby prevent changing the default stack
   size.  The function pthread_default_stacksize_np is available in both
   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some
   shared libc versions which returns a zero size if pthreads are not
   active.  We provide an equivalent stub to handle cases where libc
   doesn't provide one.  */

  /**
   * @brief  A non-owning observer for a pointer owned by a shared_ptr
   *
   * A weak_ptr provides a safe alternative to a raw pointer when you want
   * a non-owning reference to an object that is managed by a shared_ptr.
   *
   * Unlike a raw pointer, a weak_ptr can be converted to a new shared_ptr
   * that shares ownership with every other shared_ptr that already owns
   * the pointer. In other words you can upgrade from a non-owning "weak"
   * reference to an owning shared_ptr, without having access to any of
   * the existing shared_ptr objects.
   *
   * Also unlike a raw pointer, a weak_ptr does not become "dangling" after
   * the object it points to has been destroyed. Instead, a weak_ptr
   * becomes _expired_ and can no longer be converted to a shared_ptr that
   * owns the freed pointer, so you cannot accidentally access the pointed-to
   * object after it has been destroyed.
